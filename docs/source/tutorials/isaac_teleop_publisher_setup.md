# Isaac Teleop Setup (CloudXR / DeviceIO, in-process)

This page documents the Isaac Teleop and CloudXR bring-up for **G1 with Jetson AGX Thor or Jetson AGX Orin**.

```{admonition} Scope
:class: important
Real-robot deployment is supported on **G1 with Jetson AGX Orin or Jetson AGX Thor**. Sim2Sim (MuJoCo) can run on either Jetson platform or an x86_64 workstation.
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Completed the [Quick Start](../getting_started/quickstart.md):** you can run the Sim2Sim loop, including [installing the deployment](../getting_started/installation_deploy.md) and [downloading model checkpoints](../getting_started/download_models.md).
2. **Completed the [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md):** `.venv_teleop` is ready and `install_pico.sh` has been run on AGX Thor or AGX Orin for real-robot deployment, or on your workstation for Sim2Sim.

This page is a condensed, repo-specific version of the upstream [Isaac Teleop](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/) docs:

- [Isaac Teleop Quick Start](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/release/1.4.x/getting_started/quick_start.html)
- [`isaacteleop[cloudxr]` documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/release/1.4.x/)

## Step 1: Prepare the Jetson Host

Install the prerequisites on AGX Thor or AGX Orin. Skip packages that are already available on the host:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl git-lfs
git lfs install
```

```{note}
The remainder of this step uses Jetson-specific tools. If you run Sim2Sim on an x86_64 workstation instead of real G1 hardware, skip ahead to Step 2.
```

Enable max power mode before teleoperation:

```bash
sudo nvpmodel -m 0
sudo jetson_clocks
```

Optional thermal / over-current check:

```bash
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/oc*_event_cnt
```

## Step 2: Verify the Isaac Teleop Package

Activate the teleoperation environment and check the installed package version:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python -c 'from importlib.metadata import version; print(version("isaacteleop"))'
```

The command should print a version beginning with `1.4`. If the package is not found, complete [VR Teleop Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md) Step 2 before continuing.

`install_pico.sh` also seeds `~/cloudxr.env` with `NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=Quest3` (override by editing the file). `CloudXRLauncher` reads this on startup.

## Step 3: Start the C++ Deployment

Complete the [Installation Guide](../getting_started/installation_deploy.md) for your platform first.

Set `TensorRT_ROOT` to the package installed from the Installation Guide:

```bash
cd gear_sonic_deploy
export TensorRT_ROOT=$HOME/TensorRT

source scripts/setup_env.sh
just build                                  # first run only
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager real   # real robot
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager sim    # Sim2Sim (MuJoCo)
# Wait until you see "Init done"
```

```{note}
For Sim2Sim, first start the MuJoCo simulator on the host as shown in the [Quick Start](../getting_started/quickstart.md) Sim2Sim section, or the deployment will have nothing to control.
```

## Step 4: Launch the Teleop Streamer

From the **repo root**:

```bash
source .venv_teleop/bin/activate
python gear_sonic/scripts/pico_manager_thread_server.py --manager

# If running offboard with a display, add visualization:
#   --vis_vr3pt --vis_smpl
```

On startup the streamer brings up the in-process CloudXR runtime and logs `Isaac Teleop session initialized.`, then repeats `waiting for Isaac Teleop body data (connect the headset to CloudXR)...` until you connect the client in Step 5.

## Step 5: Connect the XR Client

Connecting the client starts the body-data stream the streamer is waiting for.

- Open the [Isaac Teleop Web Client](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client/#/real/gear/sonic) in the headset browser
- Enter the IP address of the host running the streamer
- Accept the self-signed certificate at `https://<host-ip>:48322`
- Set **Video Codec** to **H.264**
- Return to the client page and click **Connect**

Once connected, stand in the {ref}`calibration pose <calibration-pose>` and press **A+B+X+Y** on the PICO controllers to start the policy; the first press also runs the startup calibration and enters PLANNER (locomotion) mode. Then press **A+X** to switch to POSE mode for whole-body teleop, where your motion maps directly to the robot. See {ref}`Complete PICO Controls <pico-controls>` for the other modes and the emergency stop.

For quick validation, the same client URL can also be opened in a desktop browser.

If you prefer to run the WebXR client from source instead of the hosted client, follow the CloudXR/WebXR build instructions linked from the [Isaac Teleop Quick Start](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/release/1.4.x/getting_started/quick_start.html).

## Step 6: Start Camera Visualization

Stream cameras to the headset via upstream IsaacTeleop's `camera_viz.sh`. If you don't have the IsaacTeleop repo yet, clone it first:

```bash
git clone --branch release/1.4.x --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
```

Then create the environment for the camera visualization streamer:

```bash
cd IsaacTeleop
examples/camera_viz/camera_viz.sh setup
source examples/camera_viz/.venv/bin/activate
cd examples/camera_viz
```
### Optional: Camera Preview in a Window

If a local display is available on AGX Thor, AGX Orin, or a desktop simulation host, test the camera first in window mode:
```bash
./camera_viz.sh run configs/YOUR_CAMERA.yaml --mode window
```

Choosing the correct yaml configuration camera for your setup is critical. The v4l2.yaml configuration is default but other configs are available:
```bash
# run just one of these that best matches your camera
./camera_viz.sh run configs/v4l2.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/oakd.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/zed.yaml --mode window
./camera_viz.sh run configs/realsense.yaml --mode window
```
If you do not see correct output for your camera, you may need to modify the closest yaml file to your setup or create your own in the configs folder. Consider the following:
- Having more than one camera connected will modify what channel the video should be served from.
- First, try the command "lsusb" to see if your camera is connected.
- Next, use `ls -1 /dev/video*` to list all video device modes.
- If you are using a v4l2 setup (Video4Linux2), these cammands will help to debug what is possible:
  - To see the association of channels to cameras: "v4l2-ctl --list-devices"
  - For each node, see what it captures and in what pixel formats: "v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats"
  - To see full details on formats and available resolutions:  "v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats-ext"
Once you have this information, make sure the settings in your yaml config match.

### XR Camera Streaming Command

Once you are certain you have valid yaml configured, shut down any preview windows and run instead with "--mode xr", which will stream frames to Isaac Teleop:

```bash
./camera_viz.sh run configs/[YOUR_CAMERA].yaml --mode xr
```
This should also be consistent with the [instructions found at IsaacTeleop](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/release/1.4.x/references/camera_streaming.html).

## Troubleshooting

### `RuntimeError: Failed to get OpenXR system: -35`

In this setup, that error usually means the XR client is not connected yet. Re-check:

- The headset / web client is fully connected to `https://<host-ip>:48322`
- The CloudXR runtime subprocess is still alive (look for the `Isaac Teleop session initialized.` log)
- `~/cloudxr.env` exists and has the right `NV_DEVICE_PROFILE` for your headset

### Client connects but the video encoder fails to initialize

Set the client's **Video Codec** to **H.264** and reconnect.

### Camera plane is black on AGX Orin

The experimental CloudXR runtime on Orin may require the Televiz compositor for camera quads. Under the camera's `display.placements` entry, set `compositor: televiz` as described in the upstream [Isaac Teleop 1.4 camera troubleshooting](https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/release/1.4.x/references/camera_streaming.html#troubleshooting).

### `gear_sonic_deploy` build error

If `just build` fails, rebuild from scratch in `gear_sonic_deploy`:

```bash
rm -rf build
just build
```

### `isaacteleop` import error

Re-run `install_pico.sh` to reinstall `isaacteleop[cloudxr]~=1.4.0` into `.venv_teleop`. If `pypi.nvidia.com` is unreachable, check your network and the `--extra-index-url` flag.

### Body data not arriving

The streamer logs `[IsaacTeleopReader] No DeviceIO data for 5.0s, flagging disconnect` if the headset stops feeding body data. Confirm:

1. The headset is still connected to CloudXR (Step 5).
2. The Pico body trackers are paired and calibrated (see [VR Teleop Setup → Motion Tracker Setup](../getting_started/vr_teleop_setup.md)).
3. The first time the schema runs, watch for `[IsaacTeleopReader] Unrecognised body_data schema: type=...` — if you see it, the upstream `FullBodyTracker.get_body_pose().data` shape changed and `_body_data_to_24x7()` in `gear_sonic/utils/teleop/input_readers.py` needs an extra branch for the new layout.
